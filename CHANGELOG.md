## 0.27.3 – Jul 16, 2020

### Optimized
- Query builder generates reduced `RETURN` section according to the result set requested by user.

## 0.27.1 – Jun 16, 2020

### Optimized
- Queries like `{ signatures: { any: { node_id: { in: ["1", "2"] } } } }` generates
  optimized AQL like `(doc.signatures[*].node_id IN @v1) OR (doc.signatures[*].node_id IN @v2)`.

### New
- Support for signed numbers encoded with strings.
- Field `balance_delta` and `balance_delta_other` of `Transaction`.
- `when` arg to join fields – ability to include joined objects into result set only if some conditions met.
   
   In following example we return `dst_transaction` only for messages with `value` greater than zero:
  ```graphql
  query { 
      messages { 
          dst_transaction(timeout: 0, when: { value: { gt: "0" } }) {
              id 
          } 
          value
          dst
      }
  }
  ```
- Unit test infrastructure is now suitable for TDD. It starts q-server and performs graphql queries during tests. 
  
  ⚠️ Important to CI: you must run tests in environment correctly configured to start q-server connected to valid Arangodb
  with enough for tests set of data. You can configure q-server using env variables due to README.
