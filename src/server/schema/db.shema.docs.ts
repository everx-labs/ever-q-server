# Account type

Recall that a smart contract and an account are the same thing in the context
of the TON Blockchain, and that these terms can be used interchangeably, at
least as long as only small (or “usual”) smart contracts are considered. A large
smart-contract may employ several accounts lying in different shardchains of
the same workchain for load balancing purposes.

An account is identified by its full address and is completely described by
its state. In other words, there is nothing else in an account apart from its
address and state.
